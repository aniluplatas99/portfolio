<h1 style= "background-color: white;">All about me</h1>

    <p style= "size:red"> I am the youngest in my family and the most immature when it comes to having fun. 
I like going out with my friends to be able to get rid of stress that gets caused by the school pressure.
My dream is to one day go visit my grandparents and then go study abroad to South Korea because their colture is really
intresting. Im learning Korean since 9th grade and it is something that makes me happy.

<h6> Core4 </h6>
<p> The loops is to repeat certain things tha you want, and a variable is a storage location paired with an
  associated symbolic name.</p>
<p> while not done: 
  if user_input = input(type 'go in' to go in or 'stay outside' to go outside)</p>
<h7> Reflection 6/27 </h7>
<p> The difference between scratch and python is that in scratch gives you the boxes to plug them in and see the movement,
while in python you have to type eberything up and don't see the sample</p>
<p> During debugged day I was happy because I was able to do the things without needing so much help but when I was confused I
asked for help</p>
<h7> Reflection 6/30</h7>
<p> The type of group that works for me is the one that has people that kow what they are doing but also the people that are also confused
because together we could find different way to solve the stuff.</p>
<h8>Reflection 7/5</h8>
<p>In my opinion the idea of robots has changed because before I used to think that everything that moved witjout neeeding a human to help it 
  control it was a robot, but now I know that it could also involved robots that are programed to do something.</p>
<p>One thing that makes me excited about ron=botics is the coding because there as=re many ways to make it work andto follow a certain 
movement.</p>
<p>I feel like my group and I worked well because we let each other do part of the work.</p>
<h10>Reflection 7/25</h10>
  <p>A skill that could be built would be support because with support the group may feel more encouraged to share an idea and to not leave anyone behind.
    The stteps to take to strengthen the skill would be letting everyone express their idea without feeling judged. The way that we can check the iprovement
    is if everyone in the group starts to feel comfortable. We are dividing the work based on what the members in the team feel more comfortable with since
    some may feel that some topics are too sensitive. The tasks I am responsinble for would be "what happens?" and the contact information to help the people.</p> 
<h4>Reflexion</h4>
<p> My personal goal was to finish most of the page because it is really important to have mostly everything finished and then later on be able to 
fix the minor things that are needed. The adjusments that I would need to stay on task would be listening to music because while I'm
focused in the website the music lets my mind calm down and not stress out over the little things. I would like to add more motivation to the 
webpage becasue I feel like its not enough to leave in the page. </p>
