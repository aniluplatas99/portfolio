<h1>All about me</h1>
<p> I am the youngest in my family and the most immature when it comes to having fun. 
I like going out with my friends to be able to get rid of stressthat gets caused by the school pressure.
The thing I like would be listening to K-pop, watching Korean dramas, Playing with my dog, and hanging
out with my friends. The thing I dislike would be homework, tests, and when people treat my friends or family bad.  </p>
